<h1> The Best Animes According to Addison</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes(as of right now).</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
<p>The story is just amazing and when you understand everything, it's like a revelation.</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>I LOVE the animation of this anime. RIP Rengoku</p>

<h3>Love is War</h3>
<p>
    Now there are alot of rom-com slice of life animes out there that I love that could probably
    tie with this one, but it came to mind first.
